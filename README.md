# Krayon Kafe
Krayon Kafe is an online web application that allows users to provide a location (e.g. Panmure, Ponsonby) that shows them the cafes around the area, as well as provide Google Map Markers that show them where the cafes are.  

This project was built over the weekend of 1 August - 2 August, as part of the Create Camp hosted by [Summer of Tech](https://summeroftech.co.nz/) and [ANZ](https://www.anz.co.nz/personal/). This application uses the ZenbuAPI for location data, as well as a GoogleMaps API to show users the location of the cafes.  

# Motivation
The theme for this year's Create Camp was "Customer, Community and Cloud". Across the team, we've observed a huge influx of overseas kiwis moving back to New Zealand as a result of COVID-19. We decided it would be a great idea to help re-familiarize these kiwis by building a web application that converts the currency that they were comfortable with, to NZD (New Zealand Dollars), as well as find them the best place to get a cup of coffee at a reasonable price.  

This weekend was a huge learning opportunity for all of us, as the developers had minimal to no experience using ExpressJS, as well as deploying a web application to Heroku. So we were extremely excited to be able to parse data and be able to see the location appear on our web application. 

# Results
We were able to deploy our website to Heroku with the help our our great mentor Erwan! Here's a photo of the [website](https://krayon-kafe.herokuapp.com/):
